        <p>Gundam is a renowned Japanese media franchise created by Yoshiyuki Tomino and Sunrise, first introduced in 1979 with the anime series "Mobile Suit Gundam." The series centers around giant robots called "Mobile Suits," particularly the advanced "Gundams." Known for its deep exploration of war, politics, and human nature, Gundam has become a cultural phenomenon, expanding into numerous TV shows, movies, manga, and games. The unique and diverse designs of the Mobile Suits, along with compelling storylines, have made Gundam an enduring favorite among fans worldwide.</p>
        <p>Gunpla (short for "Gundam Plastic Model") refers to the model kits that replicate the Mobile Suits from the Gundam series. The process of building a Gunpla involves assembling the parts, which come on plastic runners. Builders carefully cut the pieces from the runners, trim any excess plastic, and then fit the pieces together according to the instructions. Many enthusiasts go beyond the basic assembly by painting their models, applying decals, and making custom modifications to enhance the appearance and detail. This creative process allows for a high degree of personalization, making each completed Gunpla unique. The hobby offers a satisfying blend of craftsmanship, creativity, and a deep connection to the Gundam universe.</p>
