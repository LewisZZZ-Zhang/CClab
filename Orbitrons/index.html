                <p>Earth's orbit, where they feed on solar energy and live among space debris.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>TOrbitrons are small, radiant beings that resemble irregularly shaped asteroids. They have developed fragile, wing-like appendages to navigate through space debris, though these wings are not strong enough to fully protect them from collisions.</p>

                The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record. (This is from Wikipedia, write the story, history, facts, tales, myths, anecdotes about your creature.)
