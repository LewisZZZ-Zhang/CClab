                <p>Solaviidae</p>
                <p>The Solaviidae family, currently represented by the sole known species Solavion orbitronis, exists as an enigma in the vastness of space. 
                    Scientists are debating whether the concept of a "family" is even appropriate for this solitary species, given that it diverges significantly from known Earth-based organisms. 
                    The absence of related species within the Solaviidae family further complicates their classification.

                <p>At an altitude of 36,000 to 40,000 kilometers in geostationary orbit.
                Weather satellites, navigation satellites, and space debris are at the same altitude.

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Orbitrons used to be small beings that resemble irregularly shaped asteroids. But with the threat from sapce debris, they are developing fragile, wing-like appendages to navigate through space debris, though these wings are not strong enough to fully prevent collisions.</p>

                Orbitons have existed unseen for centuries. There are recorded observations of this kind of weird shaped asteroid through the history of astronomy. It was only with the recent evolution of its wings that humans became aware of this creature's existence. Scientists have observed a sharp decline in this creature over a short period, widely believed to be caused by space debris and fragments left by human space exploration in Earth's orbit, which has led to the decline and spurred evolution. 
                The mechanism by which this creature can fly in space is unknown. The prevailing scientific opinion is that its wings act as some kind of solar sail, using radiation pressure to move. For research and conservation purposes, led by several space exploration companies, humans are launching missiles into space to clear debris from Earth's orbit.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> 
                We are trying to save this creature. The creature can move a little to save itself from the debris, but it is not enough. We need to help them. 
                The missile we launch into the space can distrory the debris and save the creature. But be careful, the missile can also hurt the creature.
                The creatrue also response to the aiming system of the missile. As it runs away from the aiming system, it can also be a way to guide it trought the debris.
